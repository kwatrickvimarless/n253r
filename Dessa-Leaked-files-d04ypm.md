Like many social media personalities, Dessa has faced her fair share of controversies and criticisms. From her explicit content to her involvement in various feuds, Dessa's online presence has been a subject of debate and discussion. However, she has always remained unapologetic about her choices and has used these controversies as opportunities to engage with her audience and address any concerns or misconceptions. Since her breakthrough exhibition, Dessa has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Dessa has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016.
